Feature list for shell
======================

* Simplest version:
  -- read in a line
  -- split on whitespace
  -- do appropriate fork/exec
  -- not even a PATH env variable, so need full paths

* Add PATH support so don't need full paths.

* Get/set environment variables.
  -- getenv, setenv functions

* Line editing support (look for CPAN module; worst case can use rlwrap).

  -- also need to install Term::ReadLine::Gnu
  -- also handles history but you need to manually invoke it

* directory stack i.e. pushd popd dirs

* $ support for shell variables

* control structures (probably avoid for now)
  -- e.g. for foreach while
