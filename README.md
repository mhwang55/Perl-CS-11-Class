# Perl-CS-11-Class
A new Caltech CS 11 class I'm making

Will include topics such as an intro to Perl, interfacing with databases, interfacing with servers, web crawling, and more.

Intro is finished, interfacing with databases and servers groundwork is finished.  Still figuring out what I want the assignments to cover (pull data from wikipedia?)

Begun web crawler assignment
