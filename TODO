TODO list
=========

-- some docs on how to install using CPAN (very simple, links OK)
-- some comments/docs on individual files i.e. what this file is all about
-- flesh out the example programs

== 5/4

General: want a list of assignments and brief discussion in a separate text
file.

General: try to structure code better e.g. put in functions where appropriate

hw 4: refactor, clean up, more docs, DEBUG.

hw 5: need to have a task for which threads are useful e.g. a threaded web
crawler.  Consider copying/modifying hw 4 code for this.

== 5/10

-- Upload doc with brief description of each lab.
-- Flesh out web crawler (lab 5).
-- (maybe) flesh out grep program (lab 6).
-- Build minimal shell (lab 7) according to shell-features doc (just the first
   features).
-- Lab 8: Advanced shell features from shell-features lab.

== Other ideas.

Rough increasing order of difficulty:

Write wget/curl in perl.
Write an SCP clone.
Write a simple text editor in perl.  Use curses.
